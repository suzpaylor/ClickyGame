# Clicky-Game
University of Utah Coding Boot Camp - Clicky-Game - Homework (REACT, Heroku)

**Game Instructions** - Try to click on each LOL doll just once. When you click a players picture the grid will automatically shuffle. The goal of the game is click all 18 dolls' pictures once despite the shuffled grid. If you click any of the characters twice the game will reset and  you must begin again!

**Comments** - The Clicky-Game primarily introduces REACT and all its benefits. Though this game is not persistent it is easy to understand the reusable component concept using REACT truly improves the development process.
